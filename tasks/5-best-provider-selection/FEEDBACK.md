| Task Step                     | Completion Time (in minutes) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Create a `harvest.js` script  |            180               |
| Create an `execute.js` script |            100               |

### Feedback:
Please provide any feedback you have regarding each task step below:

#### Step 1: Create a `harvest.js` script
Creating my first executor script was a challenging task, but the initialization process was straightforward thanks to the excellent guide provided in the documentation. However, I encountered difficulties when it came to utilizing the API reference for executing more trivial tasks. Specifically:

1. Understanding how to interpret results and retrieve a list of providers and associated costs was not clearly explained or readily available in the Task High level API. It was challenging for me to determine which objects should be used for this purpose.
2. I also struggled to find a way to prevent a single provider from taking multiple tasks. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an option to assign only one task per provider.


#### Step 2: Create an `execute.js` script
I faced a significant obstacle in my progress when I reached a bottleneck. The issue lies in my inability to access the provider's data and pass it as an argument. Regrettably, there is no documentation available to guide me through this particular challenge, so I had to implement a workaround that involves manually waiting for the task. Furthermore, I experienced inconsistency when running the same script. Sometimes it ran smoothly and successfully, but other times it was buggy and frequently hung without any indication of the cause.

## General feedback:
The website, https://preview.golem.network/, is truly impressive, offering a modern and user-friendly UI/UX experience. The smooth design and user-oriented approach are commendable. However, I have one comment regarding the Terms & Conditions agreement. Currently, it redirects to Google Docs, but it would be preferable if the agreement were integrated into the site itself to maintain design consistency. Additionally, it would be valuable to incorporate accessibility options for individuals with hearing or visual impairments, further enhancing the outstanding user experience already provided.


### Suggestions for Improvement
The API documentation provided at https://docs.golem.network/creators/javascript/docs/ is currently in an early stage and requires further clarification. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the API documents are inaccessible, leading to '404 - Not found' errors. This makes it challenging for users to navigate through the documentation and accomplish even simple tasks. To improve usability, it would be beneficial to adopt a more modern approach, such as providing tutorials for each task and comprehensive explanations on how to use various options and functions. This would greatly enhance the user experience and facilitate a better understanding of the API capabilities.

Furthermore, the mid-level API documentation is absent, and no guidance is provided. It would be helpful to include constructive examples on how to use the middle API to assist users in leveraging its features.

The mid level API documentation is abset and no guidance whatsover is provided, with no examples, please add more constructive examples on how to use the middle api.

Thank you for your feedback and for contributing to the Golem Network!
