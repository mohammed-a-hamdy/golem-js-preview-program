### Feedback:
Please provide any feedback you have regarding each task step below:

#### Step 1: Create a `harvest.js` script
Creating my first executor script was a challenging task. The initialization process was straightforward, thanks to the excellent guide provided in the documentation. However, I encountered difficulties when it came to utilizing the API reference for executing more trivial tasks. For instance:
1. Understanding how to interpret results and retrieve a list of providers and associated costs was not clearly explained or aviliable for that matter on Task High level API. I found it challenging to determine which objects should be used for this purpose.
2. I also struggled with finding a way to prevent a single provider from taking multiple tasks. Unfortunately, there was no option available to assign only one task per provider.


#### Step 2: Create an `execute.js` script
I have encountered a significant obstacle in my progress as I have reached a bottleneck. The issue lies in my inability to access the data of the provider in order to pass it as an argument. Regrettably, there is no documentation available to guide me through this particular challenge.

## General feedback:
The website, https://preview.golem.network/, is truly impressive, encompassing all the essential elements for a modern webpage UI/UX experience. Its smooth and user-oriented design is commendable. However, I do have one comment regarding the Terms & Conditions agreement. Currently, it redirects to Google Docs, but it would have been preferable if it were built into the site itself, maintaining the same design consistency. Additionally, it would be a valuable addition to incorporate accessibility options for individuals with hearing or visual impairments. This enhancement would further amplify the already outstanding efforts put into creating an awesome user experience.


### Suggestions for Improvement
The API documentation provided at https://docs.golem.network/creators/javascript/docs/ is currently at an early stage and requires further clarification. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the API documents are not accessible, leading to '404 - Not found' errors. This weak and disorganized referencing makes it challenging for users to navigate through the documentation and accomplish even simple tasks. To improve the usability, it would be beneficial to adopt a modern approach to pathways, such as providing tutorials for each task and comprehensive explanations on how to use various options and functions. This would greatly enhance the user experience and facilitate a more seamless understanding of the API capabilities.

The mid level API documentation is abset and no guidance whatsover is provided

Thank you for your feedback and for contributing to the Golem Network!
